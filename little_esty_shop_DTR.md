# Little Esty Shop DTR

## Group Member Names: Jenny Branham, Khoa Nguyen, Genevieve Nuebel

#### Project Expectations:
  * Try and split things up where possible and will rotate partners regularly.
    * Since there are three of us, one person will work on own and have group of 2. Then we can rotate.
  * From CSV and creating rake task is something we should tackle together, once complete then we can split up.
    * We believe this is just seeding the file using the CSVs.
  * Spread things out accordingly for soft deadlines so that we are not loading too much on at once.
    * In the event we can't hit a date just communication with each other early and often

#### What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

  * Would like to finish the project but the learning is more critical for the journey.
  * Solidify the learning goals from upcoming classes that relate to the project.
  * ReSTful routes and resource routes, solidifying which is the right way to go when we are going from a view in one controller to another controller.
  * How to consume APIs
  * Perhaps incorporate another API if we have time or additional extensions
  * Exploring things that are outside of what in the user stories or in class that we can incorporate into the project.
